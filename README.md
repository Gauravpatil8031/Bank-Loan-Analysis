# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive financial dashboard built using Tableau Public to analyze bank loan data. The objective of this project is to explore loan distribution, repayment trends, borrower risk grades, and state-wise performance.

The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders understand lending patterns, identify high-risk segments, and evaluate repayment behavior using clear and interactive visualizations.

## Business Questions Addressed

- How has loan disbursement changed over the years?
- Which loan grades carry higher financial risk?
- What is the distribution of loan status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current)?
- How does verification status impact repayment behavior?
- Which states show higher loan volumes or default rates?

---

## Data Source

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains structured information related to bank loan applications. The data includes:

- Loan Amount
- Grade & Sub-Grade
- Loan Status
- Verification Status
- Issue Year
- State Information
- Total Payment

The dataset was cleaned and prepared before visualization.
